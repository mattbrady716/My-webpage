        <h2>Goals for Tuesday February 13, 2018</h2>
        <ul class="Goals">
          <li>Complete the version control an application using GIT drills today and submit them</li>
          <li>Review flexbox by going through slides and watching a flexbox break-out video</li>
          <li>Contact Veterans Affairs and figure out what is going on with school tuition</li>
          <li>Take multiple breaks using the Pomodoro Technique.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Refection</h3>
        <p>Today's goals were all met early on today. First, I found that doing these goals went very well for me. They allowed me to stay on track and be more efficient. There was not a whole lot of wasted time trying to figure out what I wanted to do next. This is important for me because I tend to bounce around. Second, I tried using a timer for my work and realized that it helped with productivity. The twenty-five minutes that I was supposed to work at a time seemed very achievable and I was able to stay focused throughout that period. This being the first time that I have done a reflection there was a few things to improve on for tomorrow's goals. My next set of goals will be more ambitious or at least have more of them while maintaining attainability. I had plenty of extra time today. I'd also like to make the results a little more specific. The prime example of this is the flexbox goal of watching slides. That could go on forever. How many slides? I think setting specific drills would be more beneficial to getting more done. All the other goals from today were clearly defined and then accomplished.</p>

        <h2>Goals for March 12, 2018</h2>
        <ul class="Goals">
          <li>Figure out what is wrong with my computer and if any of the things I lost can be recovered.</li>
          <li>Review CSS positioning, Flexbox, and CSS Grid in preparation to redo my multi-page websites</li>
          <li>Write atleast the HTML for my first multi-page website so that I can focus on CSS tomorrow</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Refection</h3>
        <p>Today was a rough day as far as my computer issues. I ended up losing anything that was not pushed to Github. This is a setback and a hard lesson learned. I will definetly push much more often in the future.</p>
        <p>The other two goals went really well though. I reviewed alot of CSS and learned a lot more while doing this. Most of it was a review but, I discovered flex-flow which is pretty cool as I feel flex-direction and flex-flow are used a lot together. Also, I was pretty unfamiliar with align-content and kind of mixed it up with align items before this. Finally, going through the CSS grid game was kind of helpful as before all I had done is read about it. There were a few things that I had never used before.</p>
        <p>Finally, I completed writing the HTML for my first site. This is starting to become comfortable and easier which feels good. I hope to get this finished by tomorrow night so I can get it graded and make sure its right.</p>

        <h3>Refection</h3>
        <p>Today went pretty well. Early this morning i knocked out the learn to learn techniques and and the first of the set short term goals. I also wrote out these goals for the last L2L so I could reflect on them at the end of the day. I completed my meetup drill as well exept for the contact information of the people I met. This is at home and can easily added and submitted tonight.</p>
        <p>I discovered a few cool meetups this week. There wasn't a lot going on tomorrow that interested me. Tonight the Founder Institute Denver Demo Day: Watch Promising Startups Pitch Onstage looked pretty interesting. There is also a Denver Devs Happy hour tonight as well. As I really wanted to work on my website tonight I found a introductory blockchain meetup on Thursday to have the option this evening.</p>
        <p>This afternoon I got into the CSS part of of my multi-page website. This went pretty well. I didn't get as much done as I'd like but, I did finish up all of my Firebase drills. Overall, I think today was productive and I'm excited to hopefully have another good day tomorrow.</p>
