        <p>Objectives: Define a higher order function Write a higher order function Effectively use a higher order function</p>
        <h3>Set The Stage</h3>
        <p>I began setting the stage by eliminating all of my typical distractions. I closed slack, exited my web browser, turned off the notifications, and put my phone away from my desk. The only things I needed open were Atom and Iterm2 in order to write/test functions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiGfEoGMjT0</p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>I wasn't entirely sure what a higher learning function was so I began by doing some research. MDN taught me that this is a function that does at least one of the following; The function calls upon a function or returns a function. So in order to begin I wrote two simple functions. The first was function add (p1,p2) {p1 + p2}. The second was function multiply (p1, p2) {p1 * p2}. These were then logged to make sure they work and they functioned correctly. I then wrote a higher order function. It read function calculator (myFunction, num1, num2){return myFunction (num1, num2)}.
        I now had figured out what a HOF is and had written a fairly simple one. In order to effectively use it I played with various console logs evaluating what each one did and what each little change changed. As I made mistakes and figured them out I made notes for the future. I feel like I have a basic understanding of how these work now. From here I'd like to research these more and incorporate HOF into my other drills where applicable. Overall, I found these to be quite interesting. Setting the stage went fairly well. Next time I'll consider location. I kept getting moved around with breakouts which was another form of distraction to me.</p>

        <h2>Css Review March 12, 2018</h2>
        <p>Objectives: Go through the CSS, Flexbox, and Floats sections of the Galvanized Standards and drills. Complete the Flexbox Froggy and CSS grid games without using my notes. Establish enough confidence to complete my multi-page websites.</p>
        <h3>Set The Stage</h3>
        <p>I set the stage the same way as last time. I closed slack, any extra tabs, turned off notifications, and put my phone away from my desk in my bag. My big problem in my last reflection was location and getting distracted. I overcame this by finding a quiet room with nothing going on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRoMb5vdKeo</p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>I think going through this again was very beneficial for me. There was a lot of information the first time through and some of it wasn't retained. I began by going through the CSS section. I was able to get a better understanding of the different positioning types more so than just the static and relative. Using absolute and fixed is going to be useful in the future. This section also taught me about pseudo classes. The only one I had used previously was hover. It was very interesting to see some new ones. :Visited and :nth-child were two that I tried out.
        I then moved on to floats and flexbox. Most of floats was review, but I did learn about clear: both. This can be useful trying to make an element on a new line. Flexbox had a few cool things as well that were more specific than I was using. Align-self is align-items for a single item. I also liked the order: allowing you to rearrange/move items. Align-content was also clarified. I sometimes got it confused with align-items. The last thing I learned was that flex-direction and flex-wrap could be combined into flex-flow.
        The two games both went well. There were a few hiccups the first time through flexbox froggy. I was able to go through it unassisted the second time through. CSS Grid was accomplished the first time through without notes. Overall, I think this review went really well and set me up to complete my other projects. Setting the stage went much better this time. I learned that I'm easily distracted last time and a quiet place with nothing going on helped alot.</p>

        <h2>Firebase March 13, 2018</h2>
        <p>Learn what Firebase is, deploy a website on Firebase, and complete Firebase Drills</p>
        <h3>Set The Stage</h3>
        <p>I began by setting the stage. I have figured out what works for me so I stuck with that. I turned off slack, put my phone away, turned off notifications, found a non-distracting enviroment, and closed extra tabs/apps. I also took a walk for a couple minutes before starting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiGfEoGMjT0</p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> I knew right from the beginning that Firebase was a hosting site because it was under the publish section in the standards and drills. I didn't know it was run by Google. It seems to have some really cool features as well beyond just hosting including various tests and reports.
          Initially when trying to get started with the practice I ran into a problem installing firebase. I'm not sure why this is because on my last computer it went right through. After reinstalling node.js and doing a little research I found that many people were having the same issue. Eventually, I tried using a Sudo in front of my CLI command and it went right through. That honestly was the only issue I had. I was able to launch the practice website along with all three of the other websites in the drills using simple CLI commands.
          I feel pretty confident in launching websites and it's pretty cool to be able to see them online. Firebase seems to have a lot more features that'd I'd like to explore if we continue to use the site.</p>
