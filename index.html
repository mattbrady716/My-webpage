          <p>My name is Matthew Brady and I'm a 31 year old web development student in Denver, CO.  I am originally from Lowell, MA which is about thirty minutes north of Boston.  I attended University of Massachusetts studying accounting before entering the Coast Guard.  I worked for a total of about six years doing cocaine interdiction in the Caribbean.  When I finished doing that I moved to Charlottesville, VA to attend UVA.  At University of Virginia I studied commerce with a specialty in Finance.  Upon completion of that education I moved out to Denver in order to obtain my MBA from CU Denver.  After doing that program for awhile I made a life change in order to learn how to code.  That is how I ended up doing what I'm doing now. </p>

          <h2>Learning to Learn</h2>
          <p>Programmers approach problems in a very methodical way that allows them to tackle complex problems.  There are three steps to this process.  First, the stage must be set.  This means to clear distractions, establish what is to be learned, and to prioritize process over product.  Second, is to play with the problem.  This means wrestling with it finding what works, taking risks, and having fun solving the puzzle.  Finally, the last step is to reflect on the process.  This means self-assessment by asking questions of what went well and what didn't work.  It also means learning from the experience and repeating these steps. I have included links to a couple of blog posts below so everyone can see my process.</p>

          <h2>Goal Setting</h2>
          <p>A dream is something you wish would happen; a goal is something you intend to make happen.  Setting SMART goals is an excellent way to accomplish more.  SMART is an acronym that stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.  These are pretty self-explanatory.  It basically means to state exactly what you are trying to learn over the course of a specific time period.  That goal should be relevant to what you are trying to learn and be attainable.  Also, the goal should be set in a way that it is easily seen whether the goal is met or not.  I have included links to a few reflections of mine on goal setting below.  </p>

          <h2>Meet Ups</h2>
          <p>Networking is what will get you a job in the first place. Meetups are a great way to connect with the local community, meet other developers and hiring managers, learn new technologies, and stay in touch with what's happening in the development community.  They are also a great way of getting exposure to different fields that you may not have considered otherwise.  I have attached a few links to meet ups that I have attended below this.</p>
