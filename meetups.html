        <h2>Meet Up Info</h2>
        <p>GatsbyJS and Reason with ReasonReact meetup on Tuesday February 20,2018</p>
        <h3>People I Met</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Danny Radden who was a React Developer for 303 Software in CO. He graduated the Turing school fairly recently.</li>
          <li>Josh Long who was a React event cordinator. He was also running this event as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>This was my first experience with React. I had no idea what it was before the meeting. I learned that the GatsbyJS language deals with the user-interface. It has many pros including server side rendering. The presenter had built a wordpress page that showed how changes can almost instantly be seen on the browser. The page wasn't reloading anytime when navigating internally throughout the site. He said it was a bit difficult to learn, but once learned it was simple to use. It was open sourced and frequently updated by developers. Overall, it seemed like a really cool thing to use for simplistic projects, but it had it's limitations.</p>
        <h3>Questions I Have</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What is ReasonReact?</li>
          <li>Are there any other cons besides being something new to learn and not supporting all browsers?</li>
          <li>He said that that it's not ideal for email. Why?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Meet Up Info</h2>
        <p>I went to the AI into Production w/ Live Demo by Michael Demoret of NVIDIA at Galvanize Platte on February 21, 2018</p>
        <h3>People I Met</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Matt Fornito who runs a data science company and is a founder of the Denver AI meetup.</li>
          <li>Katelin Perry who is a former freelance programmer and now is a producer at 22squared.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>I learned the importance of comparing preformance and latency to the accuracy in the developement of AI. This was demonstrated through the use of flower recognition. There is a certain point where speed and detection kind of reached an equalibrium. The hardware being presented was incredibly powerful called the TensorRT tool by Nvidia. Depending on the company's needs there were various levels of preformance. I also learned about machine learning and how when moving towards developement there is a lot of time and money put into this. There is a point that is reached where money is being wasted and the product needs to moved forward. They talked a bit about Python which sounded interesting and I'd like to research it more.</p>
        <h3>Questions I Have</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>After leaving I researched the topic a little more to find out if this has many applications in the financial world. I found that most AI leaders don't think so. I'd like to know why not? I was a little lost towards the end, but thought it'd be a profitable market.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Meet Up Info</h2>
        <p>New Tech Meetup Denver March 15, 2018</p>
        <h3>People I Met</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Jeff Cozart CEO of Juniper Unmanned</li>
          <li>Taylor Kaplan CEO of Centari, a software rescue consulting company</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>I really enjoyed this meet up. It was very organized. They had a speaker and had a lot of job opportunities along with good networking. The speaker was Jeff Cozart who was the CEO of Juniper Unmanned. As the CEO he definitely was coming from the business side of things, but still had a lot of interesting stuff to share. Some of their latest projects used drones and helicopters to predict future potholes on roads, observe different components along utility lines, and calculate how grades on roads affected fuel economy of construction equipment.</p>
        <p>During the Q&A portion of the meet up a lot of the attendees were asking questions about security in terms of location services on phones. I found it interesting how many ways they could pinpoint you even without those services turned on. A couple of the ones mentioned were air pressure, time zone, altitude, cell phone towers, and a couple apps like Uber were mentioned. We then went into a discussion on the pros and cons of everything becoming AI. It was cool to see all the different perspectives coming from different backrounds.</p>
        <h3>Questions I Have</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>As I mentioned before the speaker was coming from the business side of things and wasn't super technical. He seemed to really focus on the Financial stuff. I found his topic kind of interesting but, I would like to dive a little further into it or hear from someone on the more tech side of things.</li>
